    "In that task you need to choose an object of your interest so you will be able to make a series of photos of it from different viewpoints. For simplicity of explanation, consider you will move you camera from left to right, say clockwise. You are better to move camera in the same horizontal plane. So you make first shot, then move camera a bit to the right (Do it in reasonable way, but just to hint a bit, let's say, if you capturing an object in 30 centimeters, you move mobile phone by 2-3 centimeters). Then make new shot and repeat the process. You should make from 15 up to 23 frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**! Important:** you will need to resize your images to the size of near *600x450*, the particular size does not matter, it would be better for you to keep aspect ratio of the original shots. The higher image resolution, the longer COLMAP will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1.a **(1 point)**. Capture images properly (you get 1 point only if you get at least one `.ply` by COLMAP)\n",
    "* 1.b **(0.5 point)**. Resize images. Save resized images (`.jpg`) in `.zip` and attach them `images.zip` in Canvas.\n",
    "* 1.c **(0.5 point)**. Make 3 subsets of the images, so you in each subset you have from 5 to 9 consecutive frames, and each subset have intersection of 2 frames (the same 2 frames). Plot each group of images on one plot\n",
    "* 2.**(1 point)** Run COLMAP to obtain point clouds for each subset. You should have 3 point clouds\n",
    "* 3.**(3 points)** Register 2 point clouds, then register the rest point cloud to the already registered point clouds. Save the result as `task2.ply`. Make several (3-4) screenshots with obtained point cloud. Plot them here in the notebook\n",
    "* 4.**(1 point)** Run COLMAP to obtain point clouds for all images you had originally. Make several (3-4) screenshots with obtained point cloud. Plot them here in the notebook\n",
    "* 5.**(1 point)** Compare the results, describe in 1-2 sentences. If COLMAP does not work for all images, but works for 3 separate sequences, explain why it could be so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More recommendations, according to [official COLMAP guide](https://colmap.github.io/tutorial.html#structure-from-motion):\n",
    " - Capture images with **good texture**. Avoid completely texture-less images (e.g., a white wall or empty desk). If the scene does not contain enough texture itself, you could place additional background objects, such as posters, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Capture images at **similar illumination conditions**. Avoid high dynamic range scenes (e.g., pictures against the sun with shadows or pictures through doors/windows). Avoid specularities on shiny surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Capture images with **high visual overlap**. Make sure that each object is seen in at least 3 images â€“ the more images the better.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Capture images from **different viewpoints**. Do not take images from the same location by only rotating the camera, e.g., make a few steps after each shot. At the same time, try to have enough images from a relatively similar viewpoint. Note that more images is not necessarily better and might lead to a slow reconstruction process. If you use a video as input, consider down-sampling the frame rate.\n"
